# AutoInventory1
Program to automate the inventory management based on a set of rules.

To run, simply clone the repository and open the solution file. Run the program.
As the input was not specified in the task, the program expects a CSV file (can be changed to a different data source, e.g. SQL).

After initial load, "End Day" button can be clicked to use the program output as the new input and run the algorith again.
